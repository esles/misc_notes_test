To rewrite/merge the two programs


Use a header programme written in Python, for setting the initial Conditions
running the relevant programmes and recording the results

First maybe organise all the required subroutines already written by me and KB

Assess where there is already overlap

Re-write what needs to be rewritten, especially if it helps to make sense of it

split what you can of the main programs into further subroutines (evolution,
Runge-Kutta maybe?)

Organise the printing and saving aspects of subroutines,
but put what you can in the python script


Option A
write a new header program for the fortran scripts which imports the initial
conditions from the python script and runs all the subroutines

Option B
Run your and KB's programs each in the python header and compare the saved results

I reckon the second.


Currently your program saves alot more data (density at different times) (maybe
too much?!) i guess for now its fine for a first comparison but it could be cool
to get KBs save the same amount later for more in-depth analysis


First comparison should be of three present day density profiles, one for each
model: linear, simplified silent, Einstein-de-Sitter

Not sure what the initial time/red shift should be

Nor the best time and space steps to use (KB deals with world-lines anyway?)


need a set_parameters with input from the python script
